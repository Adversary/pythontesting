# This is my first own project. I have learned some basics python.
# It`s time to put this to a test.
# I know that this will most likely not be popular.
# So I have no intensions of making this a public thing.
# I will need to learn a few things on the way, but I know
# most of the features I want to do before I begin.
# Things will most likely come up during my prosess, but thats why I do this.
# To learn.
